INSTALLATION
------------

To compile bitfield from source code:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure --prefix=DIRECTORY
$ make

This will build both a static and a shared version. To build just one of them, 
replace "make" with "make static" or "make shared".

To test the compiled library:

$ make check

The generic way to install the compiled files is:

$ make install
$ ldconfig

However, one might prefer to use distro-specific installation mechanism (like 
"checkinstall") instead.
