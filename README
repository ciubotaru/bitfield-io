bitfield
========

Version 0.6.0 (October 15, 2016)

bitfield-io is a library of functions for input-output operations with bit
fields (or bit arrays), i.e. series of zeroes and ones spread across an array
of storage units (unsigned long integers).

Installation
------------

To compile bitfield from source code:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure --prefix=DIRECTORY
$ make

This will build both a static and a shared version. To build just one of them,
replace "make" with "make static" or "make shared".

To test the compiled library:

$ make check

To build and run some example applications:

$ make example

The generic way to install the compiled files is:

$ make install
$ ldconfig

However, one might prefer to use distro-specific installation mechanism (like
"checkinstall") instead.

File format spec
----------------

The format of this file is independent of CPU, architecture, OS etc.

The file has two components:
* size -- the size of the bit array is stored in the first 2 bytes of the file
in little-endian order.
* bit -- the array of bits are stored starting from the third byte, 8 bits per
byte.
